Clients can respond by submitting a simple text response (e.g., "Done", "In progress", "Need help", etc.).

There is no complex structured status tracking like "completed" or "in progress" with automatic status changes — it’s manual and free-text at this stage.

Clients can submit impressions without a strict time limit after the session.

Impression Editing is not allowed.

Deletion of impressions is not supported — once submitted, impressions remain in the system.

Can psychologists edit/cancel scheduled sessions?

Yes, psychologists can edit (change time) or cancel sessions.

If the session is edited (rescheduled), the Google Meet link remains the same unless explicitly regenerated.

If the session is canceled, it simply disappears from the future sessions lists; the Meet link is no longer displayed or used.

Can clients cancel/reschedule sessions?

No, only psychologists can manage sessions.

Clients can only view their scheduled sessions and join at the assigned time.

Can psychologists edit/delete their notes and recommendations after creation?

Yes, psychologists can edit and delete their own notes and recommendations after creation.

Can clients see all notes created by psychologists?

No, notes are private/internal and only visible to the psychologist.

Clients do not have access to psychologist notes at all.

For recommendations - is there a status system?

No formal status system is implemented (like "pending", "completed", "in progress").

Progress is indicated manually through client responses (free-text).

For session history - do clients see the same information as psychologists?

No, clients see a filtered view:

Clients see their session dates, impressions, and received recommendations.

Psychologists see full session details including notes (which are not visible to clients).

Can either role export/download their session history?

No export/download functionality is planned at this stage for session history.
